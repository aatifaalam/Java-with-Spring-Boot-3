# Java-with-Spring-Boot-3
Learn how to build web applications in Java with Spring Boot 3. You'll learn about Spring's fundamentals by creating a REST API that communicates with a database and is supported by a comprehensive suite of tests. By the end of this course you will have learned what you need to start building your own web applications with Spring Boot 3.

Welcome to SpringBoot Learning Journey!

Congratulations on embarking on your journey to learn Spring Boot! This README file is here to guide you through your learning process and provide you with some essential information to get started.

What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is a powerful framework built on top of the Spring framework. It simplifies the development of Java applications by providing a set of conventions and auto-configurations that allow you to quickly build production-ready applications with minimal setup.

Getting Started

1.Java and Spring Basics: Before diving into Spring Boot, make sure you have a good understanding of core Java concepts and basic Spring framework principles such as dependency injection and inversion of control.

2.Setup Environment: Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. You can download the latest JDK from the official Oracle website or adopt OpenJDK.

3.Spring Boot Installation: Spring Boot can be easily added to your project using Maven or Gradle build tools. You can start a new Spring Boot project from scratch using Spring Initializr or add Spring Boot dependencies to an existing project.

4.Learning Resources: Utilize online resources such as tutorials, documentation, and video courses to learn Spring Boot. The official [Spring Boot Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/index.html) is an excellent place to start.

Key Concepts to Learn

1.Auto-Configuration: Understand how Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you include.

2.Starter Dependencies: Learn about starter dependencies which provide a quick way to add commonly used libraries and frameworks to your project.

3.Spring Boot Annotations**: Explore annotations such as `@SpringBootApplication`, `@RestController`, `@Autowired`, etc., and understand their roles in Spring Boot applications.

4.Spring Boot Actuator: Discover how to monitor and manage your Spring Boot application using Actuator endpoints.

5.Spring Boot Data: Learn how to integrate data persistence into your Spring Boot application using Spring Data JPA, MongoDB, or other data access technologies.

Sample Projects

1.Todo List Application: Build a simple todo list application using Spring Boot to understand the basics of RESTful APIs, data persistence, and dependency injection.

2.E-commerce Platform: Create an e-commerce platform with Spring Boot, incorporating features like user authentication, product catalog, and shopping cart functionality.

Community Support

Join online communities such as Stack Overflow, Reddit's r/java, and the Spring Boot community forums to ask questions, share knowledge, and connect with other developers.

Conclusion

Spring Boot is a powerful framework that can significantly simplify your Java development process. By following this guide and exploring various resources, you'll quickly become proficient in building robust and scalable applications with Spring Boot. Good luck on your learning journey! If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the community or consult the documentation. Happy coding!

Ah, I see! You're referring to annotations in Spring Boot. Annotations play a crucial role in configuring and managing various aspects of a Spring Boot application. Here's a list of some commonly used annotations in Spring Boot:

1. @SpringBootApplication:
This annotation is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. It combines three other annotations:

@Configuration
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan.


2. @RestController:
This annotation is used to define RESTful web services. It combines 
@Controller 
@ResponseBody annotations.


3. @Controller:
This annotation indicates that a class serves as a controller in a Spring MVC application.


4. @Service:
This annotation is used to mark a class as a service component in Spring. Service classes contain business logic.


5. @Repository:
This annotation is used to mark a class as a repository in Spring. Repository classes are used to interact with a database.


6. @Component:
This annotation indicates that a class is a Spring component. It's a generic stereotype annotation for any Spring-managed component.


7. @Autowired:
This annotation is used to automatically inject dependencies into a Spring bean.


8. @Qualifier:
This annotation is used along with @Autowired to specify which bean to inject when multiple beans of the same type are available.


9. @Value:
This annotation is used to inject values from properties files into Spring Beans.


10. @Configuration:
This annotation indicates that a class provides Spring configuration. It's used along with @Bean to define beans.


11. @Bean:
This annotation is used to define a bean in Spring configuration.


12. @RequestMapping:
This annotation is used to map web requests to specific handler methods in a controller class.


13. @PathVariable:
This annotation is used to extract values from the URI template in Spring MVC.


14. @RequestParam:
This annotation is used to extract query parameters from the URL in Spring MVC.


15. @ResponseBody:
This annotation is used to indicate that a method return value should be bound to the web response body in Spring MVC.


16. @ExceptionHandler:
This annotation is used to define methods to handle exceptions thrown by request handling methods.


17. @Transactional:
This annotation is used to mark a method, class, or interface as transactional in Spring.

These are some of the most commonly used annotations in Spring Boot applications. Depending on the requirements of your project, you may also come across and use additional annotations provided by Spring and Spring Boot.
